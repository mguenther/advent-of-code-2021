# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code season 2021. My programming language of choice was again Python this year. I didn't bother using PyPy, but went with vanilla CPython. All solutions compute in a reasonable amount of time.

I did solve only the first part of day 19. Day 19 was by far the hardest puzzle to solve. Although I did generate an idea on how to solve part 2 of day 19, I didn't had the muse to type it all down and debug it for what I can only imagine to be hours (given the overall sentiment on the resp. subreddit).

Solutions for day 23 and 24 were done by hand, so there is no code involved.

I did get the feeling that the solutions to some puzzles were rather test data (or input data) dependent, than problem-dependent, which can be a somewhat frustrating experience. But then again, coming up with puzzles that can be solved in a general fashion (given the number of different sets of input data that AoC provides) is extremely hard. Matching them to liking of a lot of different people on top of that is impossible.

Kudos to Eric Wastl for another great year of Advent of Code.
